# WooCommerce AI Agent - Project Planning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI agent for e-commerce stores, specifically focusing on WooCommerce integration. The agent will help store owners manage their online stores through natural language interactions.

## Main Goals (MVP)

1. **AI Agent Capable of Complete WooCommerce Store Management**:
   - Perform CRUD operations on products, coupons, orders
   - Answer general information questions about the store (inventory, order status, etc.)

2. **Use MCP Protocol** to connect tools (WooCommerce REST API) to the agent:
   - Independent MCP server mapping WooCommerce API to tools
   - Agent can use tools through natural language to perform actions

3. **User Interface (Dashboard)**:
   - ChatGPT-style chat interface allowing ongoing conversation with the agent
   - Configuration form for API keys (OpenAI, WooCommerce)
   - Display of logs and actions

4. **Conversation Memory During Session**:
   - Agent maintains conversation context throughout the current session
   - Each new agent activation starts a fresh conversation

## Architecture (High Level)

The project consists of four main components:

### 1. Agent Backend (Python)

- Uses OpenAI Agents SDK (or alternative) to manage conversation and tool calls
- Manages temporary conversation memory (in memory) + logs (writing to text file)
- Handles natural language understanding
- Executes appropriate actions based on user requests

### 2. MCP Server (Node.js or Python)

- Maps functions (CRUD) to WooCommerce REST API
- Exposes them as "tools" that the agent can call through MCP
- Handles authentication with the store

### 3. Integration Layer (Node.js)

- Bridges the Python agent with the Next.js frontend
- Handles API routing and request/response formatting
- Manages communication between components
- Provides a unified API for the frontend

### 4. Frontend (Next.js + React)

- Configuration form for API keys and store details
- Chat with the agent (sending messages and receiving responses)
- Logs page (Pull or SSE from log file/endpoint)
- Displays conversations and potential issues
- Multiple pages for different functionalities (dashboard, agent configuration, API keys, etc.)

## Technical Stack

### AI Agent
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework Options**:
  - OpenAI Agents SDK (recommended for MVP)
  - LangChain
  - PydanticAI
- **Features**:
  - Conversation memory (in-memory for current session)
  - Natural language understanding
  - Tool usage (via MCP)
  - Error handling and recovery

### MCP Server for WooCommerce
- **Existing Solution**:
  - TechSpawn WooCommerce MCP Server (https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@techspawn/woocommerce-mcp-server)
  - Ready-to-use MCP server with WooCommerce integration
- **Alternative Options** (if custom implementation needed):
  - FastAPI + FastAPI-MCP (Python)
  - Express + easy-mcp (Node.js)
- **Features**:
  - Complete WooCommerce REST API integration
  - Exposes all store operations as tools
  - Handles authentication with the store

### Integration Layer
- **Language**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Features**:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Communication with Python agent
  - Request/response handling
  - Error handling and logging

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **UI Library**: Material UI or Chakra UI
- **Features**:
  - Configuration management
  - ChatGPT-style chat interface
  - Logs and monitoring
  - API key management
  - Multiple pages for different functionalities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Create separate repositories/folders for all components
- Set up basic configuration files (.env, requirements.txt, package.json)
- Define project structure and dependencies

### Phase 2: MCP Server Setup
- Primary approach: Configure existing TechSpawn WooCommerce MCP Server
- Connect to WooCommerce store using API credentials
- Test basic operations and document available tools
- Alternative (if needed): Develop custom MCP server

### Phase 3: Agent Development
- Set up Python project with OpenAI Agents SDK
- Connect agent to the MCP Server
- Write basic system prompt and implement conversation memory
- Test agent with simple commands and verify tool usage

### Phase 4: Integration Layer Development
- Set up Express.js server
- Create API endpoints for agent communication
- Implement request/response handling
- Add error handling and logging

### Phase 5: Frontend Development
- Initialize Next.js project
- Build basic chat interface
- Connect interface to integration layer
- Add settings screen and logs display

### Phase 6: Enhancements and Extensions
- Expand agent capabilities with more complex operations
- Improve prompts based on testing
- Add additional functionality
- Conduct comprehensive testing


## Milestones

- **M1**: Working MCP server connected to WooCommerce
- **M2**: Basic agent capable of using MCP tools for simple operations
- **M3**: Functional Frontend with chat interface connected to agent
- **M4**: Complete system with enhanced capabilities and testing

## Integration Points

### WooCommerce Integration
- REST API connection using consumer keys
- Complete coverage of store operations:
  - Products (CRUD operations)
  - Orders management
  - Coupons and discounts
  - Customer information
  - Store settings

### Future Messaging Platform Integration
- WhatsApp Business API
- Telegram Bot API
- Custom web chat interface

## Considerations and Challenges

### Security
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Authentication and authorization
- Data privacy compliance

### Performance
- Response time optimization
- Handling concurrent requests
- Resource utilization

### User Experience
- Natural conversation flow
- Error handling and recovery
- Clear and concise responses

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a powerful AI assistant for WooCommerce store owners, enabling them to manage their stores through natural language conversations. The modular architecture ensures that the system can be expanded and enhanced over time, while the MVP approach allows for rapid development and testing of core functionality.
